# Features
- 


# Requirements
- iOS 13.0+
- Xcode 12+ (Swift 5)
- Git (preinstalled with Xcode Command Line Tools)
- Ruby (preinstalled with macOS)
- Cocoa Pods 1.5.0
- It's highly recommended to use the Git and Ruby packages provided by Homebrew.

# Testing
Download the app codebase locally:
```sh
$ git@github.com:
```
Assuming you have a [working Cocoa Pods environment](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html), setting up the app workspace only requires installing the pod dependencies:
```sh
$ pod install
```
After that, open `name.xcworkspace` in Xcode and run the `name target`.
